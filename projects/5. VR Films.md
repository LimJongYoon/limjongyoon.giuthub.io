Virtual reality refers to an interface between a computer and a human that creates a specific environment through 3D simulation, creates a spatial and temporal experience as a user interacts with a real-world environment. VR movies are a form of viewing on a virtual reality platform, which means using a VR device the viewers enter into a VR space and follow the direction and narrative. VR movies have a narrative that they want to convey like a conventional screen movie, and are intended to effectively provide them through directing. However, since it is made in a virtual space implemented in 360 degrees, there is no frame of the existing screen movie, and an instant frame is temporarily created according to the movement of the viewer's gaze. Audience who enters a virtual space that can be viewed 360 degrees understands the situation and follows the story through free movement and interaction. This point of view can be regarded as the difference between storytelling of VR films, unlike screen films.In this study, we intend to re-produce the existing movie scenarios into VR movies, compare movies and VR movies, find out the point of change, and suggest an effective method for directing VR movies.
