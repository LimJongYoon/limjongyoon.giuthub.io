There were two problems for the elderly to experience VR content <BR>
- It is difficult for the elderly to get used to the commercial controllers <BR>
- If various interactive functions are implemented in the VR contents used by the elderly, the sense of stability or immersion in the content is disturbed.
<BR>
Thus, his project was conducted to produce controllers and contents that can be easily recognized and used by seniors over 65 years of age when experiencing psychological healing VR contents.  <BR>

By making a bird-shaped controller, We provide two effects on VR healing content by giving a feeling of petting a real bird.<BR>
- Based on the similarity between the VR environment and the controller, it provides a UI that the elderly can easily learn.<BR>
- The act of petting animals gives a sense of psychological stability.<BR>

if someone touch the area of the controller weapped with conductive thread, different game functions depending on the contact area will be executed within the content.The wings were moved using a motor, but there were opinions that there was a sense of difference, so they were removed.<BR>
This controller is used at a welfare center located in Gogang-dong, Seoul.
