 It is a bird-shaped controller UI/UX design study that allows senior citizens(over 65s) to easily learn and operate VR content without being disturbed by immersion.<BR>
There were two problems for the elderly to experience VR content <BR>
- It is difficult for the elderly to get used to the commercial controllers <BR>
- If various interactive functions are implemented in the VR contents used by the elderly, the sense of stability or immersion in the content is disturbed.

Thus, this project was conducted to produce controllers and contents that can be easily recognized and used by seniors over 65 years of age when experiencing psychological healing VR contents.  <BR>

By making a bird-shaped controller, We provide two effects on VR healing content by giving a feeling of petting a real bird.<BR>
- Based on the similarity between the VR environment and the controller, it provides a UI that the elderly can easily learn.<BR>
- The act of petting animals gives a sense of psychological stability.<BR>

If someone touch the area of the controller weapped with conductive thread, different game functions depending on the contact area will be executed within the content. The wings were moved using a motor, but there were opinions that there was a sense of difference, so they were removed.<BR>
This controller is used at a welfare center located in Gogang-dong, Seoul.
