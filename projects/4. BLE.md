Museums and exhibition halls have different experiences due to various viewing paths, but they also confuse the audience. Therefore, the exhibition hall has a variety of Wayfinding elements. This can ruin the atmosphere of the exhibition hall.In addition, it gives only limited experience to the audience because it moves with a set movement.

Currently, various AR exhibitions are planned in museums and exhibition halls, but the frequency of use is very low. This is because most people think that it is not worth more than the inconvenience of taking out the device and entering the app. AR glass is not a suitable solution now. Because it is very expensive and uncomfortable to wear for a long time.

The best movement line was thought to be a movement line that many audiences passed by, and gradually implemented AR works according to the frequency of footsteps of previous audiences.
