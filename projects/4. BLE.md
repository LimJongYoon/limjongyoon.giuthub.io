Museums and exhibition halls have different experiences due to various viewing paths, but they also confuse the audience. Therefore, the exhibition hall has a variety of Wayfinding elements. This can ruin the atmosphere of the exhibition hall.In addition, it gives only limited experience to the audience because it moves with a set movement.

Currently, various AR exhibitions are planned in museums and exhibition halls, but the frequency of use is very low. This is because most people think that it is not worth more than the inconvenience of taking out the device and entering the app. AR glass is not a suitable solution now. Because it is very expensive and uncomfortable to wear for a long time.

The best movement line was thought to be a movement line that many audiences passed by, and gradually implemented AR works according to the frequency of footsteps of previous audiences. We set about working on two points.
- People leave guest books at the expense of the inconvenience of holding paper and pens to leave memories.
- Instagram is a space for posting personal photos, but it can be a good exhibition for someone.

Triangulation was performed using BLE ADVERTISING. We built beacons that transmit signals to Arduino and built BLE scanners with Android devices

The guest book tree is produced so that Instagram photos are hung on the tree. The size of the AR object (tree) generated and the amount of photos are also increased according to the amount of movement data. We crawled photos with hashtags related to exhibition halls or museums on Instagram. The crawled photos are uploaded to the AR object in proportion to the movement data.
