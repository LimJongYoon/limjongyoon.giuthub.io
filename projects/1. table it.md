The smart table using vision recognition and projector won the Minister Award at [2017 EFESTA](KOREA)

A smart table was created where people can enjoy various contents like a giant tablet. Using `python`, a mouse cursor is implemented by hand motion recognition, and clicking is possible by folding and unfolding the hand. Thus, we can use all programs used on your computer. In addition, through color recognition, a dedicated application that cannot be enjoyed on a tablet such as table tennis and billiards was created.
